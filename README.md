# Welcome

In this repository I upload stuff to showcase my portfolio of fun projects.

It contains a mix of all kinds of projects, without any particular order of importance.


# Andre Moreira's Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio
Hello there! 👋 Welcome to my project portfolio. Here, you'll find a curated selection of my data science, machine learning, and AI projects. With a background in theoretical physics and a passion for coding, I've ventured into the world of data to unlock insights, create predictive models, and offer sophisticated data analysis solutions. Together with my team, we are on the brink of launching a cutting-edge consulting service, blending scientific rigor with modern AI techniques.

## Projects Overview:

### GPT-Comparison
