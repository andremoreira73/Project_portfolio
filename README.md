# Andre's Data & AI Public Portfolio

ðŸ‘‹ **Welcome!**

I am a theoretical physicist by training who spent a significant part of my career in business. In the past years, I have turned my attention to data science, AI, and machine learning, with a focus on applying these technologies to real-world use cases. My work combines rigorous analytical thinking, pragmatic business insights, and modern machine learning and AI techniques.

This repository showcases a small curated selection of my projects. While my most impactful work remains in private repositories due to confidentiality constraints, these examples demonstrate my approach to problem-solving and technical implementation.

**Note:** Some datasets may be excluded from here for size reasons but are available upon request.

## Featured Projects

### GPT Model Comparison Study (2023)

A systematic analysis comparing OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 capabilities using university-level academic questions across multiple disciplines. This early comparative study provided insights into model performance differences and practical implications for educational and professional applications.

**Key Highlights:**

- Quantitative performance analysis across different knowledge domains
- Practical insights for model selection in real-world applications
- Early exploration of LLM capabilities (conducted when these models were newly released)
