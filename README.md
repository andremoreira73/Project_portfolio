# Welcome

In this repository I upload stuff to showcase my portfolio of fun projects.

It contains a mix of all kinds of projects, without any particular order of importance.


# Andre Moreira's Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio
Hello there! 👋 Welcome to my project portfolio. Here, you will find a curated selection of my data science, machine learning, and AI projects. With a background in theoretical physics and a passion for coding, I have ventured into the world of data to unlock insights, create predictive models, and offer sophisticated data analysis solutions. 

[lyfX](lyfx.ai): we are launching a cutting-edge consulting service, blending scientific rigor with modern AI techniques.

## Projects Overview:

### GPT-Comparison

Description: A deep dive into the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model to understand its nuances, strengths, and weaknesses. 
I compare OPen Ai GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 using a set of university-level questions and answers.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Open Ai.
