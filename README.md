# Andre's Data & AI Public Portfolio

ðŸ‘‹ **Welcome!**

I am a theoretical physicist by training who spent a significant part of my career in business. In the past years, I have turned my attention to data science, AI, and machine learning, with a focus on applying these technologies to real-world use cases. My work combines rigorous analytical thinking, pragmatic business insights, and modern machine learning and AI techniques.

This repository showcases a small curated selection of my projects. While my most impactful work remains in private repositories due to confidentiality constraints, these examples demonstrate my approach to problem-solving and technical implementation.

**Note:** Some datasets may be excluded from here for size reasons but are available upon request.

## Current Venture

I co-founded [**lyfX.ai**](https://www.lyfx.ai) - we help organizations in the process industries - such as chemicals, fertilizer, and energy - integrate Data and AI solutions that address their business challenges and deliver measurable results.

## Projects

In my public repositories, I showcase selected technical aspects of recent projects. Each repository contains an explanatory README. This is not an exhaustive list, as several projects are under NDA and therefore cannot be shared publicly.
