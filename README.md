# Andre's Data & AI Public Portfolio

👋 Welcome!

I am a theoretical physicist by training who spent a significant part of my career in business. In the past years, I have turned my attention to data science, AI, and machine learning, with a focus on applying these technologies to real-world use cases. My work combines rigorous analytical thinking, pragmatic business insights, and modern machine learning and AI techniques.

This repository showcases a small curated selection of my projects. While my most impactful work remains in private repositories due to confidentiality constraints, these examples demonstrate my approach to problem-solving and technical implementation.

**Note:** Some datasets may be excluded from here for size reasons but are available upon request.

**lyfX.ai**

I co-founded [lyfX.ai](https://www.lyfx.ai) - we help organizations in the process industries — such as chemicals, fertilizer, and energy — integrate Data and AI solutions that address their business challenges and deliver measurable results.
