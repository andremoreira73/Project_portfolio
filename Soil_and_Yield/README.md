# Background

In 2019, a company producing a novel soil enhancement product initiated a comprehensive data collection project gathering Haney soil test results from multiple farm trials comparing soils treated with the product versus untreated soils. This data was compiled into a dataset (designated as "Haney_raw_data.csv"). Concurrently, it conducted a larger-scale systematic collection of crop yield results from trials. This resulted in two distinct but partially overlapping databases: one capturing soil treatment effects, and another documenting plant response through yield measurements.

While maintaining separate datasets is not ideal, this scenario reflects common challenges in agricultural data management. Given the potential insights these datasets could provide, I undertook the task of integrating and analyzing the combined data.

**Note:** This repository contains only the analysis methodology and results. Original datasets are not included due to proprietary constraints but serve as a demonstration of analytical approaches for agricultural data.

# Key Findings

The integrated analysis revealed significant patterns in soil nutrient dynamics and crop performance following product application:

## Nutrient Availability

The data demonstrates that product-treated areas consistently exhibit enhanced nutrient availability compared to control areas.

## Yield Impact Analysis

A comprehensive meta-analysis across 891 trials revealed:

- **Average yield increase:** 21% in treated versus control areas
- **Median yield increase:** 9%
- **Success rate:** 75% of trials showed positive results
- **Nutrient-yield relationship:** While higher nutrient availability does not automatically translate to increased yields (particularly in already nutrient-rich environments), the data identifies specific conditions where enhanced nutrient availability strongly correlates with yield improvements

## Future Directions

These findings establish a foundation for deeper investigation. Additional data collection and analysis are necessary to fully characterize the mechanisms underlying the product's effects and optimize application strategies for various soil types and crop conditions.
