# Background


In 2019, we decided to collect Haney soil test data from several farm trials. This data was compiled in a dataset (here called "Haney_raw_data.csv"). In parallel to this dataset, we systematically collected, on a much larger scale, trial yields results. In other words, we had 2 distinct but overlapping databases with important data - one on NOVIHUM's effect on the soil, another with effect on the plant (using yield as a proxy).

While the situation concerning 2 distinct datasets is not satisfactory, it is a common situation when it comes to data. Furthermore, the data can lead to important conclusions and therefore it is worth spending time and effort in bringing the data together and analyzing it.

Please note that in this repository you will only see our analysis, but not the original data. It is meant for demonstration purposes only.

# Summary of the results from this case study

The data clearly shows that treated areas exhibit higher nutrient availability than control areas.

The meta-analysis of the yield differences between treated and untreated areas across 891 trials shows:

- An average yield increase of the treated sites of 21% versus control;
- A median yield increase of 9%;
- Win rate of 75%.
- Higher nutrient availability is not necessarily reflected in higher yields, as nutrients may be naturally or through fertilization already abundant enough. However in some cases the data shows a clear relationship between high yields and higher availability in treated areas.
- This data is the starting point of a deeper analysis (including collecting more data) that is necessary to clarify any further agronomic efects.
