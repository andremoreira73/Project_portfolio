# Background

Trial in Spain, following the tree development in a pear orchard. Some trees were treated with a special new product (code-named here as "NH"), others treated with a common product
("control"). The orchard was planted in 2019, containing three different pear varieties (Ercolini, Carmen and Limonera). We measured the tree trunks in 2022, using it as an accepted proxy for
tree development and health.

# Summary of the results from this case study

- The variety Ercolini (ER) reacts strongly to the treatment.
- The variety Carmen (CA) reacts to the treatment, however the difference between the samples is not statistically significant.
- Finally, the variety Limonera (LI) does not show in this period any reaction to the treatment.
