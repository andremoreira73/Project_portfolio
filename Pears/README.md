# Background

This case study analyzes a controlled field trial conducted in a Spanish pear orchard to evaluate the effects of a novel agricultural product on tree development. The trial compared trees treated with the experimental product against those receiving standard treatment (control group).

The orchard, established in 2019, contains three pear varieties: Ercolini, Carmen, and Limonera. In 2022, we conducted comprehensive trunk diameter measurements, a well-established proxy for tree vigor and overall health, to assess treatment effects after three growing seasons.

**Note:** This repository presents the analytical methodology and results only. Original datasets remain proprietary but the analysis serves as a demonstration of statistical approaches for agricultural field trials.

# Key Findings

Statistical analysis revealed variety-specific responses to the treatment:

## Variety Response Patterns

- **Ercolini (ER):** Demonstrated strong positive response to treatment with statistically significant trunk diameter increases
- **Carmen (CA):** Showed moderate response to treatment
- **Limonera (LI):** Exhibited limited response, suggesting variety-specific treatment efficacy

## Analytical Approach

The analysis employed multiple statistical dimensions using:

- Seaborn for comprehensive data visualization
- SciPy statistical package for hypothesis testing and significance analysis
- Multi-factor analysis to account for variety-treatment interactions

## Implications

These results highlight the importance of variety selection when implementing new agricultural treatments, as genetic factors significantly influence treatment response.
